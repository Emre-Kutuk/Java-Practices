This application creates its own data everytime it runs, in order to prevent that please comment "CreateData" method out in Main.java.

OrderList, Maintenance and Order views, and their UI setup are initialized in the Dashboard class. Thus, "Display..." methods are longer than 30 lines.

Add Article, Confirm Order and Customer List windows are initialized in their own class.
